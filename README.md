### Hi, I'm ParthðŸ‘‹

**parthanand-in/parthanand-in** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.-->

I'm a software engineer who is passionate about making contributing to open-source more approachable, creating technology to elevate people, and building community. Some Languages I enjoy working with include Swift, Html, Css, Js, Python, Java, C, React Native, Ruby on Rails,ReactJS, Jamstack (JavaScript, APIs + Markup) and GraphQL. In 2020, I was selected to be an inaugural GitHub Star ðŸŒŸ based on my involvement in the tech community. My interest in the React ecosystem led me to launch CovidSafe, a community School Going Children.
